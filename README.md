# CU-Lecture-Downloader

A litle bash script that records Carleton University lectures.

Building and lecture duration can be specified. Up to you to find out where/when your lecture is aired. <a href="http://vod.cuol.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Web-Channel-Winter-2016-schedule-by-day3.pdf"> Here's the schedule for reruns </a>

The script allows you to record lectures live, or schedule recordings to run on a weekly basis. 
(Computer must still be running at time of recording)

Source is 1200kbps but output quality depends on the available processing power. On my old server I get a solid 480p/320kbps.
